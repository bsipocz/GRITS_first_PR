I guess you are reading this because you want to use my code. These
are the available functions:



    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

Note that if this is supposed to produce the factorial if the input number, it's wrong; there's probably a bug in the code that needs addressing.

These displays all the fibonnaci numbers below the number you input:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
