**Tutorial README code**

Ok so I guess you are reading this because you wanna use my code. There are examples what funcitons will do:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    10!

Generate Fibonnacci array:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
