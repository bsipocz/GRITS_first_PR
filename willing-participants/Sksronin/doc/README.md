Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. There are some
functions you can use, such as computing the factorial of integer:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    >>> 3628800

or generating a list with the fibonacci sequence up to some value:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    >>> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Let me know if you find bugs and we can fix them!
