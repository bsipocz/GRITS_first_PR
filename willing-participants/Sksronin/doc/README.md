This code has some useful functions, such as computing the factorial of integer:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    >>> 3628800
	
	

or generating a list with the fibonacci sequence up to some value:

    >>> from simple_functions import fibonnaccci
	>>> fibonnaccci(100)
    >>> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	
or determining if an integer is a prime number:
    
	>>> from simple_functions import is_prime
	>>> is_prime(10)
    >>> False

Let me know if you find bugs and we can fix them!
